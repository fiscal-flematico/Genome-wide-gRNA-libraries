# Genome-wide-gRNA-libraries
Tool to generate genome-wide gRNA libraries for fungal genomes.

The starting material are genomic sequences (ORF & CDS catalogues) and the output is a .fasta file with spacer(s) for each predicted gene. Commands for customizations, such as spacer length, flanks for cloning, number of spacers, Cas9 effector requirements, etc., are provided.

Working example is _Aspergillus niger_ NRRL3.
