# Genome-wide-gRNA-libraries
Tool to generate genome-wide gRNA libraries for fungal genomes
The starting material is genomic sequences (ORF & CDS catalogues) and the output is a .fasta file with spacer(s) for each predicted gene.
Working example is Aspergillus niger NRRL3.

Created by Jun Lyu and Juan Pablo Morán Torres for Utrecht University Microbiology lab un der supervision of H. A. B. Wöste.
